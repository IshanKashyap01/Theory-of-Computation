# Regular Grammar

- Regular grammar represents regular languages

- In their production, there can only be one non-terminal on either side

- Therefore, regular grammar productions are either entirely RLG or entirely LLG

- However, the grammar represented by an RLG can also be written as an LLG and
vice-versa

- For instance, the RLG $S \rightarrow{aS}\ |\ b$ can be transformed into and from the LLG:

    $S \rightarrow{Ba}$

    $B \rightarrow{b}$
