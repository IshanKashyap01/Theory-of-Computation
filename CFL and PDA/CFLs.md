# Context-Free Languages

- These are the languages where the context in which a non-terminal appears has
nothing to do with its production

- CFLs are more expressive than regular languages but less expressive than CSLs

- Unlike RLs, there are some decision problems regarding CFLs that are **undecidable**

- That is, these problems cannot be solved algorithmically; for example, the
equivalence of two CFLs

- *A CFL **over one symbol** is also a **regular language***

## Types of CFL

- As there exist CFL languages that can only be recognized by an NPDA, CFLs are
also divided into **DCFLs** & **NCFLs**

- Similar to PDAs, $DCFL \subset NCFL$
