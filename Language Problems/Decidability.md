# Introduction to Decidable & Undecidable Problems

- All recursive languages (RLs, CFLs, CSLs ReLs) are *decidable*

- RELs are *semi-decidable* as TMs can accept the strings in them but may or may
not reject the ones not in them

- Whereas non-RELs are *undecidable* as they are completely unrecognizable by
turing machines

- Non-RELs are also not closed under any operation i.e. no operation can turn
them into an REL
