# Applications of Various Automata

- Automata is a machine that can accept the words of a language `L` to produce
a meaningful and intended output

- The expressive power of an automata is determined by the class of languages
it can accept

- ${FA < DPDA < PDA < LBA < TM}$

## Finite Automata

- It is used for designing *lexical analysis* of a compiler

- For recognizing patterns using *regular expressions*

- For implementing *spell checkers*

- Used in *text editors*

- Can be used as a model for *learning and decision-making*

## Push Down Automata

- It is used for designing *syntax analysis* of a compiler

- For implementation of applications that require a stack

- For evaluating *arithmetic expressions*

- To verify and validate the correctness of software models

- In *NLPs* for parsing sentences and recognizing parts of speech

- In formal verification of s/w and h/w systems

## Linear Bound Automata

- It is used for *semantic analysis* of a compiler

- For implementing genetic programming

- For recognizing context-sensitive languages

- In game theory to model and analyze interactions b/w agents

## Turing Machines

- It is used for solving any *recursively enumerable problem*

- For implementing *artificial intelligence* as a model for learning and decision-making

- For implementing *neural networks*

- For implementing *robotic applications*

- As a theoretical model to analyze *time and space complexities*

- In computational biology to model and analyze biological systems

- To analyze human-computer interactions
